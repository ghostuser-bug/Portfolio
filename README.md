### This program is inefficient because first reason: Admin need to input details of the inventory 1 by 1. Then the code is design to store within RAM using an array so once the program closed the inventory will dissapeared. So in this folder /Inventory-Management-System I will improve this program and upload it at "/Inventory-Management-System/Revamped" till then stay tune!
==========================================================================================
### To address the flaw this program have I will udate the program to revamp the feature admin will no longer type details 1 by 1 as it will be change to read from file wether its word,txt or excel and memory issue will changed to store in sql files,txt files or excel files.
